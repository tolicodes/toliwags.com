* `yarn start`: Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload if you make edits
* `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
* `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
* `yarn deploy`: Builds and deploys to surge.sh
