Hello. My name is Toli. I'm lover of experimentation, dogs, yoga, and travel. And I am a full stack Javascript Developer.

My passions are creating simple, intuitive interfaces, promoting animal welfare, healthy living, and mental health education.

I work full time at [HOVER](hover.to), but I am available for consulting projects. My specialties are Prototyping/MVPs, Data Visualization, Code Reviews, Scaling Javascript Frontends, and Social Media Marketing.

I've worked with all sorts of companies: big, small, startups, small projects, agencies financial, health, politics, you name it. My past clients include [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/), [Federal Reserve](https://www.newyorkfed.org/), [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/), [Percolate](https://percolate.com/), and [Chanel](http://www.chanel.com/#languages). Here is a [complete list of clients](#clients).

I try to inform those that I work with that I have [Aspergers](https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/asperger-syndrome) and [Bipolar Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml). With this information, my clients and coworkers can collaborate with me much more effectively and channel my strengths into producing incredible work. These afflictions have not held me back from having a full life and a passionate friend, programmer. In fact often times, I have been able to channel my disorders into creativity and productivity. I'm happy to speak about how to work most effectively with my condition and I strongly recommend the donation-based book, [Mental Health in Tech: Guidelines for Mental Wellness in the Workplace](https://leanpub.com/osmi-mental-wellness-in-the-workplace) written by the [Open Source Mental Illness Foundation](https://leanpub.com/u/osmi).
